description about triplets-array-check.js:
assume arrays a and b are persons.
defined arrays are a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].

If a[i] > b[i], then array a is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] < b[i], then array b is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] = b[i], then neither array receives a point.
Comparison points is the total points a person earned.
